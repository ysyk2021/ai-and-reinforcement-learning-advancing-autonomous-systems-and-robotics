Reinforcement learning is a powerful approach to machine learning that enables agents to learn from experience and optimize performance over time. In this chapter, we will explore two widely used reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-Learning and SARSA.

Q-Learning
----------

Q-learning is a popular algorithm for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which are a formalism for sequential decision-making problems. In Q-learning, an agent learns to select actions that maximize a cumulative reward signal, called the Q-value, by iteratively updating an estimate of the Q-function using the Bellman equation:

Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α(r+γmax⁡a′Q(s′,a′)−Q(s,a))Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha(r + \\gamma\\max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)) Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α(r+γa′maxQ(s′,a′)−Q(s,a))

Here, sss and aaa represent the agent's current state and action, respectively. s′s's′ is the resulting state after taking action aaa in state sss, rrr is the immediate reward received for taking action aaa in state sss, α\\alphaα is the learning rate, and γ\\gammaγ is the discount factor.

Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm, meaning that it learns the optimal Q-function regardless of the policy being followed. This allows Q-learning to explore different policies while still converging to the optimal solution.

SARSA
-----

SARSA is another popular reinforcement learning algorithm that is similar to Q-learning. However, SARSA is an on-policy algorithm, meaning that it updates the Q-function based on the current policy being followed by the agent. The name SARSA stands for "state-action-reward-state-action," which refers to the fact that SARSA learns the Q-value associated with a pair of states and actions.

Like Q-learning, SARSA uses the Bellman equation to update the Q-value estimate. However, in SARSA, the next action is chosen based on the current policy being followed by the agent, rather than simply selecting the action with the highest Q-value:

Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α(r+γQ(s′,a′)−Q(s,a))Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha(r + \\gamma Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)) Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α(r+γQ(s′,a′)−Q(s,a))

Here, a′a'a′ is the next action selected by the agent based on the current policy.

Because SARSA is an on-policy algorithm, it can better account for changes in the policy during learning. However, this also means that SARSA may take longer to converge than Q-learning.

Conclusion
----------

Q-learning and SARSA are both powerful reinforcement learning algorithms that enable agents to learn from experience and optimize performance over time. While Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal Q-value regardless of the policy being followed, SARSA is an on-policy algorithm that updates the Q-value based on the current policy being followed by the agent.

Both Q-learning and SARSA have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem being addressed. However, by understanding these two algorithms, researchers and practitioners can build better reinforcement learning systems and advance the field of autonomous systems and robotics.
